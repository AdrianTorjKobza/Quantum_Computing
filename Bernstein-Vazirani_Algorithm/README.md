The Bernstein-Vazirani Algorithm is a quantum algorithm designed to solve the oracle problem where the goal is to find a hidden binary string efficiently.

**Classical Methods**: Requires n queries to find the hidden string.
**Quantum Speedup**: The Bernstein-Vazirani algorithm finds the hidden string with only one query to the oracle.
