Rz gate.

S gate is Rz gate with z = pi/2. <br>
Apply two S gates = Z gate

S-dagger gate is Rz gate with z = -pi/2. <br>
Apply S gate and apply S-dagger gate = identity matrix.

T gate is Rz gate with z = pi/4. <br>
Apply two T gates = Z gate

T-dagger gate is Rz gate with z = -pi/4. <br>
Apply T gate and apply T-dagger gate = identity matrix.
